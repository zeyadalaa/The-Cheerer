# The-Cheerer
The Cheerer program is designed to address the feelings of the user, usually when the program starts the user is prompted for information (e.g. Name, Country, Age) which is used by the developers for statistics and information collecting, the user is then prompted for his personal feeling and then the software works accordingly to address the feeling of the user for example, if the user inputs a Sad feeling the program can output content such as Videos, Music or Quotes. The Cheerer also includes Developer Mode which prompts for Admin Credentials and if the input matches the database Credentials, the admin has the option to add content to the program’s database or can view all the content stored in the database.

# Program Technical Side:
The program uses files to store content in the database or view a specific content type. The videos content database is based on links that is sorted according to the feeling and is opened for the user when requested. The quotes are sorted and stored in files and  viewed when requested as well, on the other hand, the Music content mechanism is a little different, The Music provided in the application is powered by and played on Spotify, The Cheerer developer used the Spotify API provided by Spotify for other Software developers to inherit the functionality and features of Spotify to their programs, The Spotify API was used in The Cheerer to provide songs to the user based on the sorted track ids stored in the program’s database. The Developer mode Stores the input of admins to the specified content type database files and also reads the content data from the files and shows it in the program.
